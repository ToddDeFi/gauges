Key Features:

1. Fetching Gauges:

- Utilizes the ethers library for Ethereum blockchain interaction.
- Retrieves pool factory and gauge voter addresses.
- Asynchronously requests pool and gauge addresses.

2. Processing Links:

- Takes an array of links for processing.
- Uses a for...of loop to iterate through the links.

3. Result Output:

- Prints pool and gauge addresses to the console.
- Handles successful completion and errors.

Technologies Used:
1. JavaScript (Node.js):

- The programming language used for script development.
- The Node.js platform for executing JavaScript on the server.

  
2. ethers.js:

- A library for interacting with Ethereum blockchains.
- Provides convenient tools for working with contracts and providers.

  
Conclusion:
This project showcases my skills in JavaScript development and demonstrates my ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using the ethers.js library. I am eager to apply my knowledge and efforts to assist you in achieving your goals.
